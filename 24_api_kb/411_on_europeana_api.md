# Europeana API
---
## Provides:
This API provides images and information of art, collections, and other cultural heritage items across galleries in Europe. This includes, books, audios, painting, and other art

### Pain factor: 2
(0=ezpz...5=nightmare)


### Key Provisioning:     
- You can either get a general key and select which sector you will be needed data from (Culture, Education, etc.) or go into specific APIs(some require key and some don't)

### Quotas: 
- No set quota; you can query through as many times as needed; but with large requests, there will be some time delay

---

## The Good: 
- many different kinds of APIs (Search API which allows users to look up metadata records, Record API which lets users have direct access to the data and IIIFs API which allows users to display works of art in a certain way that would be aesthetic.)
- has search and facet fields to get certain data easily
- ...
## The Bad:
- there is a scalability limit (page size) which cuts down how much data you can retrieve. 
- ...
## The Ugly:
- some don't have error messages/handling mechanisms.
