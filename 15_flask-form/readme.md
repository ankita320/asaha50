K15: Take & Give
Due: 2024-10-09w before class
Your Trio Mission:

Step 0: Come together. "Form like Voltron." Learn each others' names. Introduce Duckies, fetch KtS...

Write a Flask app to echo to a site visitor their input via an HTML form. Use provided code as starting point.

Your app's response should be

visible to your visitor as a rendered page in the browser,
produced via template,
include username entered,
include request method used,
include your greeting to this person, and
showcase your clearest breakdown of the differences between a GET and POST request (generalizations welcome, but give treatment specifically to handling these in the context of a Flask app, using the shared codebase you all started from)
Also:

Display team name and roster on landing page and response page.

Specifications/Guidelines:

Use Q&A forum liberally.
Simplicity is divine.
Note anything notable in notes.txt in app's root directory.
Reminder: include heading as comment in your html and python files.

DELIVERABLES:

In your heading, replace your name with your TNPG and roster.
Save to workshop as indicated.
