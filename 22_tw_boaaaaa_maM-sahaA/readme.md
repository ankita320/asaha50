*DISCO:**
Bootstrap: the phrases/words used to added a specific component with CSS are very easy to understand and allow for more effective code.
- the alerts can be useful for user info when user doesn't meet a specific criteria, makes it easier to do without javascript
- dropdown feature is very builtin, and typically there would be a lot of code used to dispaly a dropdown, so this makes it much moe efficient.
- How does athe grid/layout system work? Is it simialr to foundations?
- Is there a default setting for styling in bootstrap for text font/size/color/etc.

Foundations:
- focuses more on structure and less on jumbling a lot of code into one simple feature.
- not very efficent
- we dont like it.

Tailwind: C: This framework focuses more on the stylistic components of the website rather than structure. However, for Foundations, there is less of a focus on style and more on structure. It seems like it is used more for adding specific/particular aspects like a name card div boxes. For tailwind, all style components.

QCC:

2. Is used the CDN different than importing/downloading it anyhow?
3. Bootstrap:
