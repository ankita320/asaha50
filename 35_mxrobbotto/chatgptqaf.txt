DOS:
- go step by step, small to big --> sometimes too much info makes it go in the wrong direction or make it too complex
- if your use transition words, it ignores everything after the last one (finally, lastly)

DONTS
- 

THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW
- sometimes it has a lot of liberty and will assume the content you want it to produce(sometimes good, like for login)
- css sucks, do  your own
- specify which libraries to us, b/c sometimes it will use ones we are not to use
