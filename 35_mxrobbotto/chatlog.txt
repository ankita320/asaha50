please create a basic flask app in python that will serve as a blog page. it should have a login, register, and logout. please use flash messages to let users to login before registering(they can't login unless they register, they cant login with in correct username or password, etc.) make sure it is correct and works accurately!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and store everything in a database sqlite3

and it doesnt require complex functions for validating emails or anything like that at all. it just takes in a usrname and password

update all the files accordingly please

please fix the register and login files

and home.html..

please do not use hash method or imports or anything like that.  Use these importsimport sqlite3
from flask import Flask, render_template, redirect, url_for, request, session, flash, and please make sure that flash messages appear on the page

the flash messages are not appearing still. please correct the code so that the flash message appears on the sceen

now, add a button for users to create a blog where they will then be able to create blog entries. please store the title, author, and contents in the database as well

now, add these features: Update their blog by adding a new entry
View and edit their own past entries
View the blogs of other users

make sure i can still create blogs tho!

c.execute("INSERT INTO blog_posts (title, author) VALUES (?, ?)", (title, author))
