Tailwind:
C: This framework focuses more on the stylistic components of the website rather than structure. However, for Foundations, there is less of a focus on style and more on structure. It seems like it is used more for adding specific/particular aspects like a name card div boxes. For tailwind, all style components.

Q:Why does Foundations framework still use a css file if it is for styling? Are there more specific, effective ways to add color, size, etc throuhg tailwind rather than focusing on structure. 
Is used the CDN different than importing/downloading it anyhow?
